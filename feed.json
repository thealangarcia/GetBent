Not Plan B, you dipshits—Plan “I’m a sociopathic fuckface.” And what happens? The court’s like, “Cool, Dave, ditch the ankle monitor.

This dude’s out here committing crimes so slimy they’d make a sewer rat gag, and the judge is like, “Just exfoliate gently, you magnificent bastard.” If that’s not America’s Next Top Psycho, I’ll chug a bottle of hand sanitizer. And let’s give a slow clap to the Washington Department of Licensing, who handed this creep a skincare license faster than you can say “we don’t do background checks, lol.” The victim’s begging to keep his ankle monitor on, screaming she’s scared shitless for her life, and the system’s like, “Chill, babe, his </span><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy r-36ujnk\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\">pores</span></span><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\"> are popping!”</span></span></div>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"> </div>\n<div class=\"css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-1qd0xha r-1inkyih r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\">Then there’s Melissa, Coots’ wife. You’d think she’d be shredding his golf shirts or googling “how to poison a cheating asshole,” but nah. This genius tries to bribe the mistress with a pathetic $2,000 to zip it. Two grand? That’s not even enough for a decent vibrator to get over this trauma, Mel! Meanwhile, Coots is violating no-contact orders like it’s his fucking cardio, dropping flowers and love notes like he’s starring in </span><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy r-36ujnk\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\">Stalker: The Musical</span></span><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\">.

Justice is taking a nap, so Coots is free until his June hearing, probably perfecting his cucumber mask recipe and creeping out every woman in Gig Harbor. Pro tip: if a soft-handed, dead-eyed fuck offers you a facial in Washington, sprint like your ass is on fire. Check your drink, your IUD, and maybe your goddamn will to live. </span></span></div>\n<div class=\"css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-1qd0xha r-1inkyih r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3\"><span class=\"css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy\">This whole saga is why you need Get Bent in your life, folks.

Trust your gut, ditch the toxic assholes, and surround yourself with people who don’t make your skin crawl. Keep bending toward the good shit, and never stop fighting for what’s right.
